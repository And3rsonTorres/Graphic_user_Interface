        <p>My name is Anderson. I am from the Dominican Republic around nine years ago. I have been in Massachusetts with my family since I moved to the United States. I was fresh out of High school at the time, and I needed to learn more English than the
            basics to continue my education. I spent at least six months in a program offered by the city to learn English. Soon I started my College experience at Northern Essex Community college. One year later, I started College, my grandfather passed
            away, and I couldn't keep myself up. My grandfather always listened to music as he was blind. I always got him any music he remembered or wanted into his MP3s. Soon after, I started taking one class at a time until graduating in 2020. furthermore,
            now I am studying at the University of Massachusetts Lowell finishing my bachelor's in computer science.One of my proudest achievements was that I bought my first house last year. Since then, I have been learning how to fix this or that. I
            am also proud of my mom and brother because they never stop encouraging me to continue studying and working. I will continue my education to honor my grandfather because my goal was to create a device to allow him to see his family again.

            One of my latest classes at Northern Essex was Graphic design. It was super abstract. I enjoyed learning with photoshop and Illustrator. I create a logo that won't showcase her as it doesn't look that great.
